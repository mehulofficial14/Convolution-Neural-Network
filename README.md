# Convolutional Neural Networks

- What type of data can Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) be applied on?
    1. Grid like data i.e. images
    2. Data can be dynamic i.e. prerecorded videos, real-time data like webcam input
- What is the use of CNN?
    1. Extract useful features from images
    2. Make recognition processes more robust
- What is the basic working of a CNN?
    1. Different neurons are activated in different layers that helps in identifying different features
